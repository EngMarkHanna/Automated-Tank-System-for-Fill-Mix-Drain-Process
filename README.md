# Automated-Tank-System-for-Fill-Mix-Drain-Process

The **Automated Tank System for Fill/Mix/Drain Process** is an advanced microcontroller-based system designed to automate the liquid handling process with improved efficiency, accuracy, and monitoring. Developed using the **PIC18F45K22 microcontroller**, the system controls the **filling, mixing, and draining** stages through a **state machine**, ensuring seamless transitions between operations. It incorporates **real-time feedback mechanisms** such as **bar graphs, LCDs, seven-segment displays, and LEDs** to provide users with clear visual indicators of tank levels and system status. The design was **simulated and tested in Proteus**, verifying smooth functionality, state transitions, and responsiveness. Additionally, **interrupts were implemented for timing, push-button detection, and state control**, enhancing automation, precision, and user interaction. This project delivers a **cost-effective, power-efficient, and reliable** solution for automated liquid management.
